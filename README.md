# ProctorLess
*Changing the way teachers take examinations* 

## INTRODUCTION
With the onset of COVID-19, students and teachers across the globe were forced to shift to online teaching. The lectures started being held over google meet or a zoom call, however, none of these software had a solution for proctoring online examinations. Human proctors were not able to check each student carefully, and thus it led to massive cheating and copying in online exams.
So with this issue in mind, we had a vision, i.e., to try to build an automated Artificial Intelligence model which could replace the human proctors and proctor each student more carefully. The model would also be able to check for similarity in the submission of students and report it to authorities. 
Apart from removing the burden from the shoulders of teachers, proctoring would become even more strict, and thus reduce misconduct and maintain the Institutionâ€™s Academic Integrity.
