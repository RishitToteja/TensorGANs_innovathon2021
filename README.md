## Introduction
With the onset of COVID-19, students and teachers across the globe were forced to shift to online teaching. The lectures started being held over google meet or a zoom call, however, none of these software had a solution for proctoring online examinations. Human proctors were not able to check each student carefully, and thus it led to massive cheating and copying in online exams.
So with this issue in mind, we had a vision, i.e., to try to build an automated Artificial Intelligence model which could replace the human proctors and proctor each student more carefully. The model would also be able to check for similarity in the submission of students and report it to authorities. 
Apart from removing the burden from the shoulders of teachers, proctoring would become even more strict, and thus reduce misconduct and maintain the Institutionâ€™s Academic Integrity.

## Why is our solution better?
1. **Higher Accuracy** : When AI would be used instead of humans for proctoring, the accuracy for detecting misdemeanor would increase. This is due to the fact that if a human were to be proctoring, he/she would not be able to check each student all the time, however if AI proctoring is used, each student would be under supervision at all times during the examination.

2. **Immediate Action** : If any anomaly is detected by AI, it would be reported immediately to the authorities and immediate action would be taken. However with human proctoring, there would be a delay between detecting the anomaly and the action taken against it.

3. **Remotely Accessible** : The AI model can be deployed easily for conduction of online examinations. Educational Institutions would not have to worry about delaying or postponing the examinations.

4. **Privacy**: No recordings or images would be saved ensuring that there is no threat of misuse and fear among students. Our AI model would be inclusive to all and prevent exploitation and promote fairness.
