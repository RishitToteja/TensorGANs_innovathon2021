## Machine Learning Models Used : 

1. **Eye Detection** :  Using OpenCV in Python made a program to Detect Human Faces and Facial Keypoints (Eyes). The project was carried out in Google Colab Environment.                                   Classifiers were loaded from OpenCV library. For Face Detection, used *haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml* and for Eyes Detection, *haarcascade_eye.xml*                           was used. Eye Detection can be used for AI Proctoring to track user's eye movements and identify where the user is looking.
                        It could help to detect Malicious Behaviour and alert the authorities.
